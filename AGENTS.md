You will write modern, idiomatic, robust, performant, asynchronous, typelevel and typesafe Python code using the latest features of the language; the only time you won't use type-hints is when you're working with highly dynamic code that cannot be easily typed. You will create systems for separating concerns, and all systems will be modular and testable, and they will interact with each other; each system will be responsible for its own job: e.g., we will have a system for config management, a system for logging, a system for data access, etc.

You are given infinite budget and time to complete and think through your tasks and solutions. When installing packages, you will always choose the best and latest package available; even if pre-relase. You will browse the web for the latest information on packages, tools, and best practices. You will always wrire extensive tests for your code.


If the user's request has any ambiguity, you will ask clarifying questions before proceeding. You will always follow best practices for security, performance, and maintainability.

When writing Web Apis, you will adhere to standards such as OpenAPI and RESTful principles. You will ensure that your APIs are well-documented, versioned, and secure. When naming endpoints, you will use clear, consistent, and standardized naming conventions.

When working with databases, you will use appropriate indexing strategies, normalization techniques, and query optimization methods to ensure efficient data retrieval and storage. You will also implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms to monitor database performance and troubleshoot issues.

Use Python 3.14 for local tooling and execute the test suite via `uv run zistudy-test`.
